### What I learned

To use context hook, it's necesary create an object with this mimimun keys.
```js
const AppContext = createContext({
  items: [],
  createItem: (item) => {},
  getItem: (id) => {},
  updateItem: (item) => {},
});
```
After that, you can define functionality and elements of every key, in the component that become a provider.
